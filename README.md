filtering, intuitive navigation, and sorting capabilities, enhancing user experience. The decks are elegantly displayed
in a tabular format for easy access and management.

To ensure secure and personalized access, the application incorporates robust authentication mechanisms, including user
registration, authorization through the Bearer authentication flow, and a seamless password recovery process. This
comprehensive approach to security and functionality allows users to focus on their learning goals with confidence and
ease.
